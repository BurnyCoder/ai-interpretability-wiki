'''[[A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits]]''' "attempt[s] to take initial, very preliminary steps towards reverse-engineering transformers" by studying transformers with two layers or less which have only attention blocks, aiming "to discover simple algorithmic patterns, motifs, or frameworks that can subsequently be applied to larger and more complex models."<ref name="framework">Elhage, Nelson; Nanda, Neel; Olsson, Catherine; et al. (2021). [https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html "A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits"]. ''Transformer Circuits Thread''.</ref> The paper finds that "by conceptualizing the operation of transformers in a new but mathematically equivalent way, we are able to make sense of these small models and gain significant understanding of how they operate internally."<ref name="framework" />
