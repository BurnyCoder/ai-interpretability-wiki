'''[[The Principles of Deep Learning Theory]]''' "develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance" and demonstrates that "the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description."<ref>Roberts, Daniel A.; Yaida, Sho; Hanin, Boris (2021).
