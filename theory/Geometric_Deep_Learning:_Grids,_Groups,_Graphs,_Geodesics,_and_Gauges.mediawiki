'''[[Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges]]''' provides "a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers" through "unified geometric principles" in "the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program," serving "a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented."<ref>Bronstein, Michael M.; Bruna, Joan; Cohen, Taco; et al.
