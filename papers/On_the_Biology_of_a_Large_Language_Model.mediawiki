<onlyinclude>'''[[On the Biology of a Large Language Model]]''' investigates "the internal mechanisms used by Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic's lightweight production model) in a variety of contexts," using [[cross-layer transcoder]] with [[Attribution graph|attribution graphs]] to "partially trace the chain of intermediate steps that a model uses to transform a specific input prompt into an output response. The paper covers case studies including multi-step reasoning, planning in poems, multilingual circuits, [[addition]], medical diagnoses, entity recognition and hallucinations, refusals, [[jailbreak|jailbreaks]], chain-of-thought faithfulness, and uncovering hidden goals in a [[alignment|misaligned]] model."<ref name="biology">Lindsey, Jack; Gurnee, Wes; Ameisen, Emmanuel; et al.
