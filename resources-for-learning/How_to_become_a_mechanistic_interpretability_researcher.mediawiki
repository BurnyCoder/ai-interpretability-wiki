<onlyinclude>'''[[How to become a mechanistic interpretability researcher]]''' is a career guide by [[Neel Nanda]] on how to enter the field of mechanistic interpretability research. Nanda argues that "mech interp is an unusually easy field to learn on your own: there's a lot of educational materials, you don't need too much compute, and there's short feedback loops."<ref name="nanda-guide">Nanda, Neel (2025-09-02). [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher "How To Become A Mechanistic Interpretability Researcher"]. ''LessWrong''.</ref> The guide outlines three stages: "Learn the ropes (≤1 month)" where you "learn the essentials, go breadth-first;" "Learn with research mini-projects" where you "practice basic research skills with 1-5 day mini projects, focus on fast feedback loop skills;" and "Work up to full projects" where you "do 1-2 week research sprints, continue the best ones. Explore deeper skills and the mindset of a great researcher."</onlyinclude>
