<onlyinclude>'''[[How to become a mechanistic interpretability researcher]]''' is a career guide by [[Neel Nanda]] on how to enter the field of mechanistic interpretability research. Nanda argues that "mech interp is an unusually easy field to learn on your own: there's a lot of educational materials, you don't need too much compute, and there's short feedback loops."<ref name="nanda-guide">Nanda, Neel (2025-09-02). [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher "How To Become A Mechanistic Interpretability Researcher"].
