'''[[Mechanistic Interpretability for AI Safety -- A Review]]''' is a review that "explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding" and "assess[es] the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to AI safety."<ref>Bereska, Leonard; Gavves, Efstratios (2024).
