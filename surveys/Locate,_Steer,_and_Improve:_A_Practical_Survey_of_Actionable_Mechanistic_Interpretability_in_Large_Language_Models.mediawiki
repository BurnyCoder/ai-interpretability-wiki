'''[[Locate, Steer, and Improve: A Practical Survey of Actionable Mechanistic Interpretability in Large Language Models]]''' is "a practical survey structured around the pipeline: 'Locate, Steer, and Improve'" that "formally categorizes Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish a rigorous intervention protocol" and "demonstrates how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization."<ref>Zhang, Hengyuan; Zhang, Zhihao; Wang, Mingyang; et al. (2026).
