'''[[Sparse autoencoder]]''' ('''SAE''') is "a weak [[dictionary learning]] algorithm that address [[polysemanticity]] by generating learned [[Feature|features]] from a trained model that offer a more [[monosemanticity|monosemantic]] unit of analysis than the model's neurons themselves."<ref name="towards-monosemanticity">[[Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning]].</ref>
