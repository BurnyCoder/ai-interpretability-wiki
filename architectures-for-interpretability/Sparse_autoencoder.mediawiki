'''[[Sparse autoencoder]]''' ('''SAE''') is "a weak dictionary learning algorithm to generate learned [[Feature|features]] from a trained model that offer a more monosemantic unit of analysis than the model's neurons themselves."<ref>Bricken, Trenton; Templeton, Adly; Batson, Joshua; et al. (2023). [https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html "Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning"].
