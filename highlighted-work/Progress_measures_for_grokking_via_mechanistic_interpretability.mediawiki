<onlyinclude>'''[[Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability]]''' argues that progress measures for emergent behavior can be found via mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering learned behaviors into their individual components.<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05217 Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability — arXiv] (paper)</ref> As a case study, the authors fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by small transformers trained on modular addition tasks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. Based on this understanding, they define progress measures that allow them to split training into three continuous phases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup. Their results show that grokking, rather than being a sudden shift, arises from the gradual amplification of structured mechanisms encoded in the weights, followed by the later removal of memorizing components.</onlyinclude>
