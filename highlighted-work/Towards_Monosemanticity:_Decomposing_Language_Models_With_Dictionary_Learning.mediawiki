<onlyinclude>'''Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning''' is a 2023 paper by Anthropic in the Transformer Circuits Thread.<ref>[https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning — Transformer Circuits Thread] (paper)</ref><ref>[https://www.anthropic.com/research/towards-monosemanticity-decomposing-language-models-with-dictionary-learning Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning — Anthropic Research] (blog post)</ref> It uses sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable features from a one-layer transformer, demonstrating that dictionary learning can decompose superposed polysemantic neural network representations into more monosemantic features.</onlyinclude>
