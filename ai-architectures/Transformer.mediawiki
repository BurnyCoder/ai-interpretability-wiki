<onlyinclude>The '''[[Transformer]]''' is "an artificial neural network architecture based on the multi-head attention mechanism, in which text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished."<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning) "Transformer (deep learning)"].
