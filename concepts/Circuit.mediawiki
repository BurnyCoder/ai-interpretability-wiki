* '''[[Circuit]]''' is "the subset of a model's weights and non-linearities used to map a set of earlier [[feature|features]] to a set of later features. Circuit is also a fairly fuzzy and poorly defined term. Intuitively, a circuit means 'the sub part of a model that does some understandable computation to produce some interpretable features from prior interpretable features'. A special case is when some of the features are the inputs or the outputs, which are inherently interpretable (hopefully!). Ideally, the intermediate steps of computation also represent interpretable features, but this is not essential."<ref name="nanda-glossary">Nanda, Neel (2022).
