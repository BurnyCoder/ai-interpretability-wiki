- '''[[Feature]]''' is a property of an input to the model, or some subset of that input (eg a token in the prompt given to a language model, or a patch of an image).<ref name="nanda-glossary">Nanda, Neel (2022). [https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary "A Comprehensive Mechanistic Interpretability Explainer & Glossary"].</ref> 
- Features are the fundamental building block of models - the model's internal activations represent features, and the model's weights and non-linearities are used to apply computations to produce later features from earlier features."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />

Examples include "this part of the image contains a curve," "this token is the final token in the phrase 'Eiffel Tower'," "this text is Python code," and "this token is the name of a variable corresponding to a list in Python code."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />

- Feature is "some meaningful, articulable property of the input which the network encodes as a direction in activation space." But this is "human centric" and "excludes the possibility of features humans don't understand."
- Features are "whatever the 'independent units' a neural network representation can be decomposed into are."
- Features are "the things a network would ideally dedicate a neuron to if you gave it enough neurons."
- The definition that features are "simply any function of the input" is unsatisfactory because "under this definition, any mixture of features is also a feature" - whereas "there's something importantly different about a 'car detector' (which seems to correspond to an important latent variable) from 'car and cat detector' (which seems to be an arbitrary mixture of things)."

In practice, the term is "normally used to describe a property of an example input that is actually internally represented in the model, rather than a feature that could be in theory," and refers to "properties of inputs that generalise across inputs."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />
