A '''[[Feature]]''' in mechanistic interpretability is "a property of an input to the model, or some subset of that input (eg a token in the prompt given to a language model, or a patch of an image)," described as "a fuzzy and non-rigorous idea, best illustrated by examples."<ref name="nanda-glossary">Nanda, Neel (2022). [https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary "A Comprehensive Mechanistic Interpretability Explainer & Glossary"].</ref> "Features are the fundamental building block of models - the model's internal activations represent features, and the model's weights and non-linearities are used to apply computations to produce later features from earlier features."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />

Examples include "this part of the image contains a curve," "this token is the final token in the phrase 'Eiffel Tower'," "this text is Python code," and "this token is the name of a variable corresponding to a list in Python code."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />

Chris Olah offers several definitions, as quoted in the glossary: the "easy answer" is that a feature is "some meaningful, articulable property of the input which the network encodes as a direction in activation space," but this is "human centric" and "excludes the possibility of features humans don't understand."<ref name="nanda-glossary" /> A more satisfying alternative is that "features are whatever the 'independent units' a neural network representation can be decomposed into are," or that "features are the things a network would ideally dedicate a neuron to if you gave it enough neurons."<ref name="nanda-glossary" /> The definition that features are "simply any function of the input" is noted as unsatisfactory because "under this definition, any mixture of features is also a feature" - whereas "there's something importantly different about a 'car detector' (which seems to correspond to an important latent variable) from 'car and cat detector' (which seems to be an arbitrary mixture of things)."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />

In practice, the term is "normally used to describe a property of an example input that is actually internally represented in the model, rather than a feature that could be in theory," and refers to "properties of inputs that generalise across inputs."<ref name="nanda-glossary" />
